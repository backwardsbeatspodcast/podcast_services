# Music API Services


## Description
This package provides basic services for music service APIs and currently needs to be run within a Google Colab environment as manages
secrets in the Google Colab secret manager.
The current state of the repository is intended to support the Backwards Beats 
podcast. As such, the re-usability is very limited.

In the future, the package will be expanded to support more music services and provide a more generic interface for interacting with them.

It includes the following services:
* Spotify
* Last.fm (coming soon)
* Discogs (coming soon)
* MusicBrainz (coming soon)
